    # Enterprise Resource Planning API v2.0.0
    
    ## Overview
    
    The Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) API is a comprehensive, monolithic application designed to streamline and integrate core business processes across your organization. This RESTful API provides a unified interface for managing critical business operations including human resources, financial management, supply chain operations, and inventory control.
    
    ## What's New in v2.0.0
    
    - **Consistent camelCase naming** across all schemas and properties
    - **Standardized response envelopes** for all endpoints
    - **Universal pagination** on all list endpoints
    - **Versioned URL paths** (`/api/v2/`)
    - **Improved error responses** with detailed error codes
    - **Consistent authentication** across all protected endpoints
    - **Enhanced status code usage** including rate limiting and server errors
    
    ## Main Features & Modules
    
    - **Human Resources**: Employee and department management
    - **Payroll**: Salary processing and tax calculations
    - **Accounting**: General ledger and financial transactions
    - **Finance**: Budgeting and financial reporting
    - **Billing**: Invoicing and customer billing
    - **Procurement**: Purchase orders and vendor management
    - **Supply Chain**: Shipments and logistics
    - **Inventory**: Stock tracking and management
    
    ## Authentication
    
    All endpoints except health check and API info require Bearer token authentication. Include the token in the Authorization header:
    
    ```
    Authorization: Bearer <your-token>
    ```
    
    **Endpoints NOT requiring authentication:**
    - `GET /health` - Health check endpoint
    - `GET /api/v2` - API information endpoint
